# NeuroDive - A Machine Learning system to decode a monkey‚Äôs arm movements from its neural activity

This code is a group coursework submitted as part of the Brain-Machine Interfaces module at Imperial College London.

---
### üßê How does it work?
The proposed neural decoder uses a 2-stage approach:
1. A classifier predicts the reaching angle for the current
trajectory. <br/> Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used for classification.
2. A linear regressor (trained on data
from the relevant reaching angle) predicts position. <br/> Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
followed by Linear Regression (LR) is used for hand position
estimation ‚Äì a technique called Principal Component
Regression (PCR)

### Task setup
Each colour represents a different reaching angle.

### üíª Usage

- positionEstimatorTraining.m: trains the model
- positionEstimator.m : predicts one hand position using the trained model
- testFunction_for_students_MTb.m: evaluates model performance on unseen test data
